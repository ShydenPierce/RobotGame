# RobotGame
the game Chase! (on wikipedia) coded in C and ncurses in my own way.  
there is no scoring  
I don't remember the controls but I believe it's g to warp and then the characters around G to move in directions (including diagonals)  
this doesnt apply to the wasd version as that's just wasd and g  
compiling is just
```
gcc -lncurses RobotGame.c -o RobotGame
```
or
```
gcc -lncurses RobotGamewasd.c -o RobotGamewasd
```
